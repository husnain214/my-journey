# My-Web-Development-Journey

Hi, here are the resources I used to start my self-taught web development journey. 

## HTML CSS

I used the 2021 HTML CSS course by Gary Simon on youtube. He does this course every year. I hadn't known Scrimba then but now I would definitely recommend Scrimba's HTML CSS course by Per Harald Borgen too. Scrimba's interactive style of teaching is extremely helpful for beginners and Per is an amazing teacher. I know that because I took his Javascript Course.

## Bootstrap

As a beginner you don't want to dive too deep into CSS. It is better to learn a CSS framework like Bootstrap 5. You can either use DesignCourse or Traversy media for that. I took the Gary Simon course but looking back I should have gone to Traversy Media because some things Gary taught were not really for absolute beginners.

## Javascript:

As I mentioned before, I used Scrimba to learn Javascript. Then, I took the ES6 course too because that was a prerequisite for the eact course.
